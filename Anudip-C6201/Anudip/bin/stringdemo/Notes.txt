String is a final predefined class.
String objects are used to store sequence of character.

Since String is a final class we will not be able to extend any class to this 
String class.

String literals create objects in SCP(String Constant Pool). It provides memory management.

When we store data in string object, each character is given an index starting from 0 to length()-1

String is a class so it has many methods in it. Most commonly used methods are:-

1) length(): this method will give you the total number of character in the String.

2) s.charAt(index): this method will get the character present at the given index
		 
3) .toUpperCase(): this method returns a new String object in which all letters are in captial

4) .toLowerCase(): this method returns a new String object in which all letters are in small

5) .contains(word): this method returns true if it finds the given word in our String otherwise it returns
					false.
				
6) .replace(oldCharacter, newCharacter): this method returns a new String in which 
											all the old character is replaced 
											by new character.
											
7) .replace("string1", "string2"): this method returns a new String in which 
											all the old string1 is replaced 
											by new string2.
											
8) .replaceFirst("string1", "string2"): this method returns a new string where only the first occurance
										of the word string1 is replaced by new string2
										
9) .indexOf('character'): this method returns the index of the first occurance of the
							 given character


10) lastIndexOf('character'): this method returns the index of the last occurance of the
							 given character
							 


11).indexOf("string"): this method returns the index of the first occurance of the
							 given string

12) .indexOf('character', startIndex): this method returns the index of the first occurance 
										of the given character starting the search from 
										given startIndex
										
13) .indexOf("string", startIndex): this method returns the index of the first occurance of the
							 		given string starting the search from 
										given startIndex										
										
										
14) .subString(index): this method returns a new String in which there are all characters 
						of the original string starting from the given index.
						
						
15) .subSting(startIndex,  offSetIndex):this method returns a new String in which there are 
										all characters of the original string starting 
										from the given startIndex upto the offsetIndex.
										Note:We will not see the character present in the
										offsetIndex.
										
16).startsWith(word): will give true if the string starts with the given word									
										
17).endsWith(word): will give true if the string ends with given word									
																
18). concat(): will create a new object with all the 
				new character attached to original value						
						
						
String is immutable; its original object cannot be changed, if we call any methods to change
the value then a new object is created.
