Java Interfaces

1 Interfaces in Java define a contract for classes, specifying a set of methods that must be implemented by those 
  classes.
	
2 Interface methods are implicitly public and abstract.

3 Classes that implement an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods declared in the 
  interface.
  
4 Multiple interfaces can be implemented by a single class, allowing for multiple inheritance of method signatures.

5 Starting from Java 8, interfaces can include default methods, providing default implementations for methods. 
  Static methods are also allowed in interfaces.

6 Interfaces can contain constant fields, which are implicitly public, static, and final.

7 Interface inheritance is supported, allowing one interface to inherit the method signatures of another interface.

8 Interfaces are widely used for achieving polymorphism and designing modular, maintainable code.
